## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start Commands

### Frontend Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npx expo start

# Run on iOS
npx expo run:ios

# Run on Android
npx expo run:android

# Build for production
eas build --platform all
```

### Backend Development
```bash
# Setup virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Start development server
python manage.py runserver

# Start Celery beat
celery -A rumoro beat -l info
```

### Docker Commands
```bash
# Build and start all services

## üìù Notes

### Current Blockers
1. **No Backend**: Frontend is ready but needs API endpoints
2. **No Authentication**: OTP system requires Twilio setup
3. **No Database**: Need PostgreSQL for data persistence

### Next Immediate Steps
1. **Set up Django project** with basic structure
2. **Implement authentication** with phone OTP
3. **Create API endpoints** for core features
4. **Test frontend-backend integration**

### Risk Factors
- Third-party API dependencies (Twilio, Google OAuth)
- App store approval process
- Scalability concerns for real-time features
- Content moderation challenges
